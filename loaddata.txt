Every app should have fixtures folder.
Similar to templates, best practice is to include a subfolder with that app's name
Then in that subfolder, inlcude json files to populate the models


Code:

Make new models and run
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Then populate the models with
python manage.py loaddate "appname"/"filename".json
e.g. python manage.py loaddata settings/load_settings_data.json
